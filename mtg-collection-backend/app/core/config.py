# This will load the settings when the module is imported
# and cache them for future use.
# You can access the settings like this:
# settings.DATABASE_URL
# This is a singleton pattern using lru_cache to ensure that the settings are only loaded once.
# This is useful for performance and to avoid re-reading the .env file multiple times.
# The settings can be accessed globally in your application.
